console.log("test")

//(1) In your own words, explain two ways that objects are different from arrays.

//Usage:
// With objects you can model real world you can create an idea and manipulate its attributes.
// Arrays are mainly to save elements.

//Structure: 
// Objects are collections of keys and values organized in pairs like "Key: Value"
// Arrays are collections of elements most of the times of the same data type (string, number, boolean...) but also combined 

//======================================================================

//(2) How do you access a value from an object in coding terms ?

// There are 2 way to access a value object :

// let object = {
//     key1: "A",
//     key2: "B",
//     key3: "C"
// }

// With dot
// object.key1 => A

// With brackets
// object[`key3`] => C

//======================================================================

//(3)What is the purpose of the keyword "this"?, Why do we use it?

//The purpose of the keyword "this" is to allow as to use any key or method within an object 
//so we use "this" to access and manipulate properties and methods within an object
